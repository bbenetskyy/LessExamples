# Less Examples in Xamarin.

This is code connected with [CSS & Xamarin](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1wIXv6_IPaeKGccFtyHMPTIEJw-qbNYKButTzOWaWJc0/edit#slide=id.g35f391192_00) presentation.

Just try to un commit parts of XAML and CSS and play with styles a little bit, all you need located at `LessExamples.Less` and in `MainPage.xaml`(and in other `xaml` pages in solution)

For installing `Gulp & Gulp-Less` open `cmd` in `LessExamples.Less` folder and type `npm install`, that's it now you can use gulp tasks to compile LESS to CSS
